# Deployment Verification Report

## Summary

- Repository contains no Docker-related configuration files such as `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`.
- Without container definitions, no containers can be started or verified for successful deployment.
- Checked commit history to confirm that earlier commits also do not include container configuration (only `secrets.env` present previously).

## Details

1. Searched the repository for Docker-related files using `find` and `rg`; none were found.
2. Inspected commit history; the initial commit only held a `telegram-bot/secrets.env` file, which is insufficient for container deployment.
3. Concluded that container deployment verification cannot proceed due to missing configuration files.

## Recommendation

Add the necessary container configuration (e.g., Dockerfiles, docker-compose manifests) to the repository so that container deployment can be validated in the future.
